# High Priority Ports - Action Plan

## Files by Impact

Priority = deps * 1,000,000 + SymDeficit * 10,000 + SrcSymbols * 100 + (1 - function similarity) * 10

Dependency fanout is ranked first so the ladder favors ports that clear downstream compilation failures fastest.

This list is complete and includes function/type detail for every matched file. Function similarity is the required body/parameter comparison; file-level shape does not rescue a port.

| Rank | Source | Target | Function similarity | Deps | Functions | Missing functions | Types | Missing types | SymDeficit | SrcSymbols | Priority |
|------|--------|--------|------------|------|-----------|-------------------|-------|---------------|-----------|------------|----------|

## Cheat Detection / Scoring Failures

_None detected._

## Critical Issues (Function Similarity < 0.60 with Dependencies)

No critical issues with dependencies.

## Missing Files (by Dependents)

No missing files detected.

## Reexport / Wiring Modules

These files match `reexport_modules` patterns in `.ast_distance_config.json`. They are filtered out of
normal priority and missing-file ladders because they are wiring
modules, not direct logic ports. Consult them for call-site routing;
do not treat them as the next implementation target by default.

### Missing

| Source | Expected target | Deps | Source path | Expected path |
|--------|-----------------|------|-------------|---------------|
| `lib` | `Lib` | 0 | `lib.rs` | `Lib.kt` |
